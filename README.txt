Alternascope is a quick and dirty way to debug circuits. Being a cheap and completely functional Oscilliscope, this is
ideal for students and hobbyists.

The entire package is developed on the Spartan III Development kit from Xilinx. On that development kit is a VGA port
and a PS/2 mouse port, making this project very easy to implement. Because of that, I have included the 
"spartanIII.alternascope.mcs" file so that people can quickly give this a shot. Keep in mind though, it is just a
sneak preview of what it can be capable of - it is not nearly close to completion... just functional.

The file "spartanIII.alternascope.mcs" was compiled using Xilinx's ISE 7.1 and targeted for the Spartan-3,
SC3S200FT256 chip. If you would like a programming file for a different target, and for some reason can't get the 
source files to compile, email me. If you would like a cheap development kit, go to www.Xilinx.com (about $100 bucks
for this one).

Eventually, I plan to make a couple of these (if there is interest) for fellow keener students like myself. Being a
4th year Electrical Engineering student (at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada), I could have used this years
ago - so hopefully it will be of aid to others.

If you have any questions, concerns, or comments, please don't hesitate to email me at smpickett@opencores.org.
